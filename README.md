This is a single file stand-alone application using R Markdown.

It was run and tested using RStudio and the knitr package. It
requires the gender, magrittr, and tidyverse packages.

Use the file with the .Rmd extension as input, or examine the
file with the .html extension to see what the output is like.

This application does not need any special files beyond the
ones listed above.
